# todos-react-vue-svelte-app
A set of Todo apps built with Svelte, Vue 3 and React. (+ Typescript)

This project was built to test the development experience with these 3 frameworks (Vue, React and Svelte).

Each one of them have their own development process, using immutable state, or two way data binding, routing system, store system and so on...

After testing all of them, not only in this project, I can say that I prefer to use <b>Svelte</b>.

Svelte feels so simple, much like vanilla JS, where the variables that you declare are already reactive (comparing to React, where you need to set functions and getters to get the value of a reactive state);

But, I don't think it has a mature community **YET**. That said, React feels more robuste to a production app.
